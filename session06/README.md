- Processor: `ATMega328P`
- Chip for USB Driver: `CH340G`
- Sensor: `Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04`

## Connection

The breadboard sholud look as below. <br />

## Run

1. Open the [.ino code](https://github.com/the-other-mariana/circuits-workshop/blob/master/session06/ultrasonic-prints/ultrasonic-prints.ino) that does something.

2. Click on Upload.

3. Open the serial port (console) to see the printed output. This button is on the top right corner.

## Stop

1. Open the [.ino code](https://github.com/the-other-mariana/circuits-workshop/blob/master/session06/null-sketch/null-sketch.ino) that does nothing.

2. Click on Upload.

3. Unplug the arduino.
