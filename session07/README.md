## Run

1. Open the [.ino code](https://github.com/the-other-mariana/circuits-workshop/blob/master/session07/ultrasonic-touch/ultrasonic-touch.ino) that does something.

2. Click on Upload.

3. Open the serial port (console) to see the printed output. This button is on the top right corner.

In this case, the output is "System Turned Off" until you press the touch sensor. Then, the ultrasonic sensor does its job until you press again the touch sensor that acts as a On/Off button.

## Stop

1. Open the [.ino code](https://github.com/the-other-mariana/circuits-workshop/blob/master/session06/null-sketch/null-sketch.ino) that does nothing.

2. Click on Upload.

3. Unplug the arduino.
